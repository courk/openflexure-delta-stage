# Printing the components

These instructions show you how to print the parts and the printed tools for the OpenFlexure Delta Stage. You don't need to print all the files.  Follow the steps below to find the right files for your configuration. 

[Delta Stage]: models/delta_stage.stl "{cat:3DPrinted}}"
[Delta Stage Microscope]: models/reflection_transmission_delta_stage.stl "{cat: 3DPrinted}"
[feet]: models/feet.stl "{cat:3DPrinted, note: All three feet are in the one file.}"
[Raspberry Pi & Sangaboard base]: models/base_raspi_sangaboard.stl "{cat: 3DPrinted}"
[simple base]: models/base.stl "{cat: 3DPrinted}"
[band tool]: actuatortools.md#bandtool "{cat: 3DPrinted_tool}"
[nut tool]: actuatortools.md#nuttool "{cat:3DPrinted_tool}"
[sample clip]: models/sample_clips.stl "{cat: 3DPrinted, note: Both sample clips are in the one file.}"
[gear]: models/gears.stl "{cat: 3DPrinted, note: All three gears are in the one file.}"
[small gear]: models/small_gears.stl "{cat: 3DPrinted, note: All three gears are in the one file.}"
## Main body
There are two options for the [main body]{output,qty:1}.

1. If you just want the stage, you will need to print the [Delta Stage]{qty:1}.
2. If you want to use the Delta Stage Microscope, you will need to print [Delta Stage Microscope]{qty:1}.

## Actuators
To control the movement of the stage, you will need to print:

1. The three [feet].
2. The three [gear]s.

## Printed tools  
To assist with the fiddlier parts, you will need to print out these tools:

1. The [band tool].
2. The [nut tool].

## Sample clips
To secure a microscope slide to the stage, you will need to print:

1. The two [sample clip]s.

## Motors

To connect the motors to the stage, you will need to print:

1. The three [small gear]s.

## Base

The base{output,qty:1} keeps the microscope steady. Choose which one you want to print:

1. The [simple base].

   or

2. The [Raspberry Pi & Sangaboard base].

# Printing the components

These instructions show you how to print the parts and the printed tools for the OpenFlexure Delta Stage. You don't need to print all the files.  Follow the steps below to find the right files for your configuration. 

We normally print with PLA using a 0.15 layer height and ~18% infill. You should not need to print any of the parts with adhesion settings (brim etc.) or supports.  Take note of the optics parts we recommend you print with black PLA, to reduce stray light.

## Main body
There are two options for the [main body]{output,qty:1}.

1. If you just want the stage, you will need to print the [Delta Stage]{qty:1}.
2. If you want to use the Delta Stage Microscope, you will need to print [Delta Stage Microscope]{qty:1}.

## Actuators
To control the movement of the stage, you will need to print:

1. The three [feet].
2. The three [gear]s.

## Printed tools  
To assist with the fiddlier parts, you will need to print out these tools:

1. The [band tool].
2. The [nut tool].
3. The [lens tool].

## Sample clips
To secure a microscope slide to the stage, you will need to print:

1. The two [sample clip]s.

## Motors

To connect the motors to the stage, you will need to print:

1. The three [small gear]s.

## Optics

### Transmission illumination



1. The [illumination dovetail].
2. The [condenser housing]. **Print in black**
3. The [optics module casing]. **Print in black**
4. The [camera cover].

### Reflection illumination

Print all of these in black PLA.

1. The [filter cube].
2. The [reflection illumination holder]. **Print in black**
3. The [reflection illumination condenser]. **Print in black**
4. The [camera cover].

### LED grid for structured illumination

1. The [LED grid holder].

## Base

The base{output,qty:1} keeps the microscope steady. Choose which one you want to print:

1. The [simple base].

   or

2. The [Raspberry Pi & Sangaboard base].



### Stage adaptors

1. The [35mm petri dish holder].

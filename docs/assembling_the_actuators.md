## Method

## Cut the ties {pagestep}

For printing stability, on the [delta stage]{qty:0} there are two plastic ties in every actuator.  Cut these out, either using a craft knife or small wire cutters.

![](images/assembling_the_actuators/no_ties.jpg)

Repeat for all three acutators.

## Assemble gear {pagestep}

Put a [M3x25mm hex head screw]{qty:3} into one [gear]{qty:3}.

Put two [M3 washer]{qty:6}s onto the screw.

Repeat for all three gears.

## Assemble acutator {pagestep}

Insert a [brass M3 nut]{qty:3} into the slot of one of the actuators, using the [nut tool]{qty:1}.

![](images/assembling_the_actuators/nut_in_slot.jpg)

Screw the gear through the hole in the top of the actuator, through the nut that you just inserted.  Apply a small amount of [light oil]{qty:small amount} to the screw thread before it is fully tightened.

Looking through the hole that the nut was pushed into, rotate the gear until you can see the hole inside align with the outside hole.  Push the [nut tool]{qty:1} into the hole so the column can't move.

Bend the [band tool]{qty:1} ready for use.

Attach one of the [feet]{qty:3} onto the bottom of the actuator.

![](images/assembling_the_actuators/foot_from_bottom.jpg)

Hold an [O-ring]{qty:3} against the bottom of the foot.  Push the [band tool] against the two sides of the [O-ring] so that the [O-ring] begins to enter the actuator.  Make sure the [Viton O-ring] aligns with the grooves of the [band tool].

![](images/assembling_the_actuators/pushing_band_tool_o_ring.jpg)
![](images/assembling_the_actuators/pushing_band_tool_o_ring_2.jpg)

Push the [band tool] hard, forcing the [O-ring] further into the actuator, whilst making sure the [nut tool] stays in place.  Once you hear two clicks (the [O-ring] has been hooked at the top of the actuator), you can remove the [band tool] and [nut tool]. The [O-ring] and the actuator should stay in place.  If not, you may need to try again and push a little further.

Repeat this step for all three actuators.

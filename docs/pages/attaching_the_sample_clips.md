## Screw the sample clips onto the stage {pagestep}

There are 9 holes on the top of the stage, allowing you flexibility when choosing where to place the sample clips. Screw the sample clip to the stage, going through the hole at the top.

If it is difficult to start screwing, then you may find it useful to tap the hole with the screw first.

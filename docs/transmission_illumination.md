## Method

### Solder the LED {pagestep}

Solder  one [330Ω resistor]{qty:1} on one leg of the [LED]{qty:1} with a [soldering iron]. 

Strip both ends of the [25cm wires]{qty:2} with a [wire stripper]{qty:1}. 

Solder the two wires on to the free end of the [330Ω resistor] and the other leg of the [LED] using a [soldering iron]{qty:1} and [solder]{qty:some}.  

Cover each leg of the LED and resistor with some [heat shrink]{qty:some} or [electrical tape]{qty:some} so that the exposed metal cannot short-circuit. 

Twist the two wires together and trim so that they are the same length.  

Using a [crimp]{qty:1}, crimp a [female crimp terminal contact] on to the ends of both the wires. 

Push both crimp terminals into a [female connector housing]{qty:1}.  

You have now made a [wired LED]{output, qty:1}. 

### Insert the Condenser Lens {pagestep}

Take a [condenser lens]{qty:1} and place it on top of the [condenser lens tool]{qty:1} with its flat side down.  

Push the [condenser housing]{qty:1} down vertically on top of the lens. make sure it is flat, pushing again harder if necessary.

### Insert the LED {pagestep}

Push the LED into the top of the [condenser housing]. If it is loose, secure it in place with some [electrical tape]{qty:some}.

### Attach the illumination dovetail

Put the [illumination dovetail]{qty:1} on the condenser mount of the [main body](fromstep).

Put one [M3 washer]{qty:2} on to two [M3 screws]{qty:1}. 

Insert two [M3 nut]{qty:2}s into the nut slots on the condenser mount.

Screw the [condenser housing] onto the [main body](fromstep).

### Attach the condenser on to the dovetail

Slide the [condenser housing] down the dovetail.  You can adjust its position up and down by sliding it on the dovetail.  You can move it back and forward by loosing the dovetail and and tightening it when it is the correct position.

# Reflection illumination

One of the best uses of the OpenFlexure Delta Stage is as a reflection illumination microscope.  These instructions show you how to assemble the optical components.

## Method

### Clean the optics module casing {pagestep}

After printing the [optics module casing]{qty:1} there may be strings or dust.  Clean these out so they won't block the light or fall onto the camera sensor.

### Attach the objective screw {pagestep}

Slide a [M3 nut]{qty:1} into the slot at the top of the [optics module casing] and screw a [M3 screw]{qty:1} into it.

### Insert the tube lens {pagestep}

Put the [tube lens]{qty:1} onto the [lens tool], with the more convex side down.

Push the [optics module casing] down on top of the lens until it is flat and secure.

### Attach the objective lens {pagestep}

Screw the [objective lens]{qty:1} into the top of the [optics module casing].  Be careful to screw it in straight, to avoid cross-threading.

### Remove the camera lens {pagestep}

Remove the plastic film from the lens of the [Raspberry Pi camera v2]{qty:1}.

Unscrew the camera lens using the camera lens tool supplied with the camera.

Once you've removed the lens, keep the camera face down or put some tape over the lens holder to stop dust settling on the sensor (which is difficult to clean!).

### Attach the camera to the optics tube {pagestep}

Attach the [Raspberry Pi camera v2] to the bottom of the [optics module casing]. Put the [camera cover]{qty:1} over the top.  Secure everything in place with two [M2 screws]{qty:1}.

### Cut the filters {pagestep}

### Put the filters in the filter cube {pagestep}

### Wire the LED {pagestep}

### Build the reflection condenser {pagestep}

### Attach the reflection condender to the reflection illumination holder {pagestep}

### Attach the filter cube to the reflection illumination holder {pagestep}

### Attach the reflection illumination module to the optics module {pagestep}
